# BLE OTA Ready ESP Project + Python Client Code

This project contains OTA update capabilities via BLE implemented using the NimBLE stack and a Python bases client code using the Bleak library. 

# References

The ESP code is based on the official example provided by Espressif: 
* https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v4.2/examples/bluetooth/nimble/blehr

The Python client code is implemented using Bleak:
